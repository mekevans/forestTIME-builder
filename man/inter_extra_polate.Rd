\title{Linear intrpolation and extrapolation}
\usage{
inter_extra_polate(x, y, extrapolate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric; an x variable, usually \code{YEAR} in forestTIME-builder}

\item{y}{numeric; the variable to be interpolated/extrapolated}

\item{extrapolate}{logical; perform extrapolation if possible?}
}
\value{
numeric vector

a numeric vector
}
\description{
Performs linear interpolation and, optionally, extrapolation.  Interpolation
is used for annualizing tree measurements such as \code{DIA}, \code{HT}, and
\code{ACTUALHT}.  Extrapolation is necessary for trees that have \code{NA}s recorded in
their first inventory marked dead because we want to extrapolate their growth
from the last time they were inventoried alive to an estimated mortality
year. In the case of vectors with only one non-NA value, that value is
carried forward if \code{extrapolate = TRUE}.
}
\examples{
x <- 1:7
y <- c(2, NA, 5, 6, NA, NA, NA)
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y)
#with extrapolation
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y, extrapolate = TRUE)
#single numbers get carried forward
y2 <- c(NA, NA, 3, NA, NA)
inter_extra_polate(x = x, y = y2, extrapolate = TRUE)
