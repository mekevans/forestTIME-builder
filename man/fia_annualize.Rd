\title{Create annualized FIA data}
\usage{
fia_annualize(data_tidy, use_mortyr = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_tidy}{A tibble produced by \code{\link[=fia_tidy]{fia_tidy()}}.}

\item{use_mortyr}{logical; Use \code{MORTYR} (if recorded) as the first year a
tree was dead? Passed to \code{\link[=adjust_mortality]{adjust_mortality()}}.}
}
\description{
Converts tidied panel data into annualized data with interpolated measurments
for trees for years between inventories. This happens in three steps, which
can be "manually" replicated by chaining other \code{forestTIME.builder}
functions.
}
\details{
First, data is expanded by \code{\link[=expand_data]{expand_data()}} to add rows for years between
inventories for each tree in the data. Next, data is interpolated with
\code{\link[=interpolate_data]{interpolate_data()}}. Finally, \code{\link[=adjust_mortality]{adjust_mortality()}} is applied. For trees
that die and/or fall between inventories, we adjust their history according
either to a recorded \code{MORTYR} (if \code{use_morty = TRUE}) or, as a fall-back, the
midpoint between surveys, rounded down. Unlike these intermediate functions,
\code{fia_annualize()} produces a dataset which can be safely used for other
analyses (with the caveat that all of this is experimental).
}
\note{
Most users should use this "wrapper" function rather than running each
step separately as intermediate steps may contain data artifacts.  However,
one reason to use the stepwise workflow would be to save time when generating
interpolated data with and without using \code{MORTYR} as \code{interpolate_data()} is
the slowest step.
